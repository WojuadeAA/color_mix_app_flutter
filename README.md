# Color Mixer App (Flutter)



## Overview

The Color Mixer App (Flutter version) is a replica of the native iOS Color Mixer App built with UIKit.

It serves as a sample project for exploring Flutter development and recreating the functionality of the original app.

## Features

- Mix colors using sliders for red, green, and blue components.
- Live preview of the resulting color as the user adjusts the sliders.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface, designed with Flutter.
- Reset option to start over with default color settings.
